It's a close debate,
but Tanjiro generally becomes stronger overall due to his mastery of Sun Breathing (Hinokami Kagura), Demon Slayer Mark, and strategic mind, while Zenitsu is unmatched in raw speed and overwhelming power bursts with his perfected Thunder Breathing, 
especially in his sleep. Zenitsu excels in high-speed attacks, 
while Tanjiro offers greater durability and versatility, ultimately proving more powerful as the series progresses, even taking on Muzan.
